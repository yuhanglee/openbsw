Using UDS
=========

Previous: :ref:`learning_can`

Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) is a widely used protocol for automotive diagnostics
that is independent of the transport layer.

Take a look at the "Systems" set up from levels 4 to 7 in as described in :ref:`learning_lifecycle`.

.. list-table::

In this example, CAN and Ethernet provide the transport layer. Note that the separation of UDS from the transport path allows multiple transports to be supported.
Take time to study these "System" classes and how they interact.

UDS over CAN
------------

If you have successfully tested the CAN setup for a POSIX platform as described in :ref:`learning_can`,
try some more tests using the same setup in which...

* ``vcan0`` is successfully set up
* ``app.referenceApp.elf`` is running in shell terminal 1
* ``candump vcan0`` is running in shell terminal 2

In a third shell terminal run...

.. code-block:: bash

    cansend vcan0 02A#0322CF0100000000

With this, ``cansend`` sends a CAN Frame with CAN ID set to ``0x02A``.
If you look in the code for ``DoCanSystem`` you will see it is set up with ``0x02A`` as the CAN ID to listen for.
The payload contains the following parts...

* The 1st byte of the payload (with value ``0x03``) is the Protocol Control Information (PCI) field for UDS over CAN.
  This breaks down into 2 parts..

    * The first 4 bits indicate the frame type (``0`` for Single Frame)
    * The last 4 bits indicate the length of the request (``3`` bytes)

* The 2nd byte is the UDS Service Identifier (SID). Its value ``0x22`` is the ID for the "Read Data By Identifier" service.

* The 3rd and 4th bytes make up the UDS Data Identifier (DID) with value ``0xCF01`` identifies which data should be returned.

The CAN frame sent was actually a UDS over CAN request to "Read" the data identified by ``0xCF01`` and return that data.

So what response should be seen?

``app.referenceApp.elf`` should print...

.. code-block:: bash

    32057178: RefApp: CAN: DEBUG: [SocketCanTransceiver] received CAN frame, id=0x2A, length=8
    32057178: RefApp: TPROUTER: DEBUG: TransportRouterSimple::getTransportMessage : sourceId 0xf0, targetId 0x2a
    32057178: RefApp: UDS: DEBUG: Opening incoming connection 0xf0 --> 0x2a, service 0x22

    32057178: RefApp: Accepted 0x22cf01, current session: 0x1
    32057178: RefApp: UDS: DEBUG: Process diag job 0x22CF01
    32057180: RefApp: CAN: INFO: [CanSystem] CAN frame sent, id=0xF0, length=8
    32058181: RefApp: DOCAN: WARN: DoCanTransmitter(CAN_0)::cyclicTask(0x2a -> 0xf0): Flow control timeout
    32058181: RefApp: UDS: DEBUG: IncomingDiagConnection::terminate(): 0xf0 --> 0x2a, service 0x22
    32058182: RefApp: UDS: ERROR: IncomingDiagConnection::transportMessageSent(): failed to send message from 0x2a to 0xf0

In the code for ``UdsSystem`` you can see that it instantiates ``ReadIdentifierFromMemory _read22Cf01``
to return ``responseData22Cf01`` for the DID ``0xCF01`` as follows...

.. code-block:: cpp

    uint8_t const responseData22Cf01[]
        = {0x01, 0x02, 0x00, 0x02, 0x22, 0x02, 0x16, 0x0F, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x6D,
        0x2F, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x06, 0x00, 0x00, 0x8F, 0xE0, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01};

    ...

    , _read22Cf01(0xCF01, responseData22Cf01)

The log line containing ``Process diag job 0x22CF01`` indicates that the "Read" request was interpreted correctly,
it found the job ``_read22Cf01`` that matched the request,
then the log line containing ``CAN frame sent, id=0xF0, length=8``
indicates it sent a CAN frame response with CAN ID ``0x0F0`` which is the ID ``DoCanSystem`` is set up to send responses with.

During the above, ``candump vcan0`` should have printed...

.. code-block:: bash

    vcan0  02A   [8]  03 22 CF 01 00 00 00 00
    vcan0  0F0   [8]  10 1B 62 CF 01 01 02 00

The first CAN frame is the request being send and the 2nd CAN frame is the response which breaks down as follow...

* The PCI is 2 bytes this time, with value ``0x101B``

    * The first 4 bits indicate the frame type (0x1 indicates it is the 1st frame of a series)
    * The next 12 bits indicate the number of bytes to follow (``0x01B`` = 27 bytes). Note this is larger than 1 CAN Frame (max 8 bytes)

* The 3rd byte is the UDS Response SID. Its value ``0x62`` is the ID for the response for the "Read Data By Identifier" service.

* The 4th and 5th bytes hold the same UDS Data Identifier (DID) ``0xCF01`` as in the request.

* The remaining bytes ``0x010200`` are the 1st three bytes ``responseData22Cf01``.

After sending the CAN frame response ``app.referenceApp.elf`` printed...

.. code-block:: bash

    32058181: RefApp: DOCAN: WARN: DoCanTransmitter(CAN_0)::cyclicTask(0x2a -> 0xf0): Flow control timeout

This indicates it is waiting for the client to request the next CAN Frame of the response.
``cansend`` is a simple tool to send CAN frames, it has no knowledge of UDS and so it did not send the next expected follow-on UDS request.
What we need is a tool that implements UDS over CAN that is capable of sending the next request expected.

``UdsTool``, which can be found in the subdirectory ``referenceApp/tools/UdsTool`` implements exactly what we need.
Assuming you have ``python >= 3.7`` installed, you can install ``UdsTool`` as instructed in :ref:`UdsTool`.
Using the same setup, with ``app.referenceApp.elf`` and ``candump vcan0`` running in separate shell terminals,
in a third shell terminal run...

.. code-block:: bash

    udstool read --can --channel vcan0 --txid 2A --rxid F0 --did cf01 --config tools/UdsTool/app/canConfig.json

If it works it should show output like this...

.. code-block:: bash

    62cf01010200022202160f0100006d2f0000010600008fe0000001
    <PositiveResponse: [ReadDataByIdentifier] - 26 data bytes at 0x7d9f586c2530>

In that you can see the response contains the data from ``responseData22Cf01``.
Looking at the log output from ``app.referenceApp.elf`` you can see that this time it received a 2nd CAN Frame with ID ``0x2A``
sent by ``UdsTool`` after which that remaining data was sent in response in CAN frames with ID ``0xF0``.

.. code-block:: bash

    37907832: RefApp: CAN: DEBUG: [SocketCanTransceiver] received CAN frame, id=0x2A, length=8
    37907832: RefApp: TPROUTER: DEBUG: TransportRouterSimple::getTransportMessage : sourceId 0xf0, targetId 0x2a

    37907951: RefApp: UDS: DEBUG: IncomingDiagConnection::terminate(): 0xf0 --> 0x2a, service 0x22

The output from ``candump vcan0`` shows all details of these CAN frames...

.. code-block:: bash

    vcan0  02A   [8]  03 22 CF 01 00 00 00 00
    vcan0  0F0   [8]  10 1B 62 CF 01 01 02 00
    vcan0  02A   [8]  30 08 20 00 00 00 00 00
    vcan0  0F0   [8]  21 02 22 02 16 0F 01 00
    vcan0  0F0   [8]  22 00 6D 2F 00 00 01 06
    vcan0  0F0   [8]  23 00 00 8F E0 00 00 01

To learn more you can experiment with adding you own services to ``UdsSystem``
similar to ``ReadIdentifierFromMemory _read22Cf01``.

UDS over Ethernet (DoIP)
------------------------

The DoIP implementation in the reference app currently uses DoIP version 2 as per ISO 13400-2:2012.

You can try the same example over Ethernet, provided you have successfully tested the Ethernet setup
on target as described in :ref:`learning_ethernet`.

Ensure ethernet interface is successfully set up and Application is running before testing DoIP.

Refer :ref:`UdsTool` for more details on sending request over Ethernet, installation and other
available commands (Service Requests).

.. note::
   - Use the target's IP address in the UDS tool command (see :ref:`learning_ethernet`).
   - Ensure UdsTool version `0.0.3` or later for DoIP-2 support. Check with: ``pip show udstool``.

To run an example request to read ``0xCF01`` DID, Open a new shell terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    udstool read --eth --host 192.168.0.201 --ecu 002a --source ef1 --did cf01

Here, ``--host`` is the IP address of the ECU, and ``--ecu`` and ``--source`` are the logical
addresses of the ECU and the client respectively.

When you run this command, you should observe output similar to the previous example over CAN:

.. code-block:: bash

    62cf01010200022202160f0100006d2f0000010600008fe0000001
    <PositiveResponse: [ReadDataByIdentifier] - 26 data bytes at 0x7d9f586c2530>

However, this time you can also see the Ethernet traffic in `Wireshark` as follows:
