Flash, debug and test serial console on Windows
===============================================

NXP's `S32 Design Studio for ARM <https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/development-software/s32-design-studio-ide/s32-design-studio-for-arm:S32DS-ARM>`_
can be used to flash and debug your image while it is running on the
`S32K148 development board <https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards/automotive-development-platforms/s32k-mcu-platforms/s32k148-q176-evaluation-board-for-automotive-general-purpose:S32K148EVB>`_.

While the Ubuntu filesystem appears in Windows Explorer at `\\\\wsl.localhost\\Ubuntu-` :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version`,
in order for the Windows version of NXP's IDE to access the build files,
it is necessary to map a network drive to **\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-**:prop:`tool:ubuntu_version`,
like this...

Install S32 Design Studio for ARM
---------------------------------

To download and install this you will first need to register for a free account with `NXP <https://www.nxp.com/webapp-signup/register>`_.
Note that free activation codes for software you download will be sent to the email account you register with.
Once registered, you can `download S32 Design Studio for ARM from here <https://www.nxp.com/webapp/swlicensing/sso/downloadSoftware.sp?catid=S32DS-IDE-ARM-V2-X>`_.

Download and run the installer S32DS_ARM_Win32_v :prop:`tool:s32ds_arm_version` .exe (this assumes you have administrator rights on your PC).
Enter the activation code received by email when prompted and chose **Activate Online**.
During the installation it will also prompt you to allow drivers from **PEMicro** to be installed - accept this.

Once complete, from **Windows Start** run **S32 Design Studio for ARM** :prop:`tool:s32ds_arm_version`.
An **S32DS Extensions and Updates** window should appear indicating if there are updates available - if so, install these.

Flash and debug in S32 Design Studio for ARM
--------------------------------------------

Assuming you have a `S32K148 development board <https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards/automotive-development-platforms/s32k-mcu-platforms/s32k148-q176-evaluation-board-for-automotive-general-purpose:S32K148EVB>`_
and it is connected to your PC via USB, then you can flash your image on the board and debug over USB.
You can create a dummy project in S32 Design Studio for ARM in the default workspace
and then change it to point to the external code and the image created as described in :doc:`setup_s32k148_win_build`.

1. In S32 Design Studio choose **File -> New -> S32DS Application Project**,
   select the processor **Family S32K1xx -> S32K148** and give the project a name. eg. “**referenceApp**“.
   You can leave all other settings at their default values.

   .. image:: nxpide_create_project.png
      :width: 80%
      :align: center

2. In **Run -> Debug Configurations** find **GDB PEMicro Interface Debugging-> referenceApp_Debug_FLASH_PNE**.
   In the **Main tab** set the **C/C++ Application** to the `.elf` file that was built by `cmake`.
   Enter the absolute path to the `.elf` file...

   .. code-block::

        [absolute_path_to_project_root]\build\s32k148-gcc\executables\referenceApp\application\RelWithDebInfo\app.referenceApp.elf

   .. image:: nxpide_debug_config.png
      :width: 80%
      :align: center

   This assumes you have already built the image for the S32K148 platform in WSL
   and have mapped the Ubuntu filesystem to the **Z:** drive,
   as described in :doc:`setup_s32k148_win_build`.
   In the above picture, **\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-** :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version` is mapped to the **Z:** drive.

3. In the **Debugger tab**, in the **Interface:** field select ``OpenSDA Embedded Debug - USB Port``.
   The **Port:** field should then be populated with an instance representing the target board connected to your PC via USB.
   If nothing appears in the **Port:** field you can try pressing **Refresh** or power cycling your target board.
   **If the target board is not found then you cannot continue until this is resolved.**

   .. image:: nxpide_debugger_tab.png
      :width: 80%
      :align: center

4. In the **Source tab** select **Add... -> Path Mapping**.
   In the **Path Mappings** window select **Add**.
   For **Compilation path:** enter the base directory of the source code as seen in Ubuntu,
   for **Local file system path** enter the same location but as seen in Windows through the mapped network drive,
   and press **OK**.

   .. image:: nxpide_path_mapping.png
      :width: 80%
      :align: center

   In the above picture, **\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-** :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version` is mapped to the **Z:** drive
   and the code has been built in Ubuntu in the directory specified by **Compilation path**.

5. If the above steps are successful then press the **Debug** button,
   this flashes `app.referenceApp.elf` to the target board and starts the debugger,
   it halts at the entry point in `main()`.
   At this point you can single-step through the code, or press the **Resume** button to run the software.
   Once flashed you can power-cycle the target board without the USB connection and it will run the software.

Test the Serial Console
-----------------------

The application running on the board uses the serial port for logging messages and to implement a command console,
which can be interacted with in parallel to debugging over the same USB cable.
This will appear as a COM port in Windows. eg. ``COM4 - (OpenSDA)``.
In order to test this you need serial port terminal software to connect to the COM port.

**TeraTerm** is one example of such software - you can `download the latest TeraTerm release from here <https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/releases>`_.

If you are using **TeraTerm**, in **File -> New  Connection** choose **Serial**, select the port with ``OpenSDA`` in its title
(if not found then you don’t have a working target board successfully connected to your PC via USB)
and select **OK**.
In **Setup -> Serial Port** set the parameters as shown below.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: auto

    * - Speed
      - Data
      - Parity
      - Stop bits
      - Flow control
    * - 115200
      - 8 bit
      - None
      - 1
      - None

If the target board is powered and the software you built and flashed on the board is running then you should see output from it printed to the console,
and if you type ``help`` you should see the commands available printed out, like this...

   .. code-block:: bash

      14: RefApp: LIFECYCLE: INFO: Run level 8

      ok

      > 4339: RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: Received console command "help"

      5022: RefApp: DEMO: DEBUG: Sending frame 4
      6022: RefApp: DEMO: DEBUG: Sending frame 5

At this point, you can build the code, flash it on the board and debug it.
You can now explore the code, make your own changes and learn how it works.
