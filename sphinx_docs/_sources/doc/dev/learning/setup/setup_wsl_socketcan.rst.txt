.. _setup_wsl_socketcan:

Add SocketCAN support in WSL
============================

If you have followed the steps in :doc:`setup_posix_build`
then you should now have an environment in which you can build and run the POSIX platform executable
and this enables experimentation and learning through making your own changes to the codebase.

But note that by default, the linux kernel used in WSL does not support CAN.
If you wish to develop some CAN based functionality while working in WSL
then you need to enable CAN support in the kernel used by WSL.
Linux also supports Virtual CAN adapters (``vcan``) which allow CAN applications to be developed without CAN hardware
and the POSIX build will use this if supported by the host platform.

Below are instructions to enable this functionality in WSL.

Before attempting this, in a Windows command shell with administrator rights
confirm WSL2 as default version...

.. code-block:: bash

    wsl --set-default-version 2

The steps below assume you have WSL2 and Ubuntu :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version` set up as described in :ref:`setup_windows_01_wsl`.

Update your existing Ubuntu distribution and install the tools needed to configure and build the kernel...

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential flex bison libssl-dev libelf-dev libncurses-dev pkg-config bc dwarves

Just for background information, note that WSL uses a single linux kernel
and if you have multiple distributions (eg. Ubuntu-18.04, Ubuntu- :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version`, Debian, etc.)
they will all use the same kernel provided by WSL.
In the instructions below you will not be replacing your existing Ubuntu- :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version` distribution,
you will be replacing the kernel it is using with a custom kernel that you will build.
The distribution and the kernel need to be compatible,
so the first thing you need to do is check what version of linux kernel is currently running by executing ``uname -r``...

.. code-block:: bash

    frank@C11-JQXQXCRB1VG:~$ uname -r
    5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2

In the `WSL2-Linux-Kernel project in github <https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel>`_
find the branch name that matches the first two numbers of your kernel.
For the case above, the matching branch is ``linux-msft-wsl-5.15.y``.

Clone the WSL kernel repo and checkout the matching branch...

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel
    cd WSL2-Linux-Kernel
    git checkout linux-msft-wsl-5.15.y

You need to configure the kernel before building it.
You can take the current kernel's configuration as the starting point...

.. code-block:: bash

    cat /proc/config.gz | gunzip > .config

The following command instructs the build system to prepare the kernel source tree (``make prepare``)
and prepare it for building external modules (``modules_prepare``)...

.. code-block:: bash

    make prepare modules_prepare

Next, launch the configuration interface so that you can choose the CAN-related features needed...

.. code-block:: bash

    make menuconfig

Navigate to ``Networking Support`` as shown below...

.. image:: kernel_menuconfig_1.png
    :width: 80%
    :align: center

Press ``Enter`` to enter its sub-menu, then navigate to ``CAN bus subsystem support``
which is empty by default - press ``M`` to select it.

.. image:: kernel_menuconfig_2.png
    :width: 80%
    :align: center

Then, while still on ``CAN bus subsystem support`` press ``Enter`` to enter its sub-menu.
You can press ``M`` on each item listed to include them all as shown below,
then navigate to ``CAN Device Drivers``...

.. image:: kernel_menuconfig_3.png
    :width: 80%
    :align: center

and press ``Enter`` to enter its sub-menu and press ``M`` for each of the items shown as selected below
and set ``CAN bit-timing calculation`` to ``*``...

.. image:: kernel_menuconfig_4.png
    :width: 80%
    :align: center

When finished making configuration changes, Save and Exit. This will write a new ``.config`` file.

Now you can build your custom kernel and modules...

.. code-block:: bash

    make -j4
    make modules
    sudo make modules_install

The newly built kernel should be found in the current directory (at the base of the WSL kernel git repo clone) as a file named ``vmlinux``.
You need to put this file in a Windows directory and tell WSL to use it at startup.
eg. Make a directory in your ``C:`` drive named ``wsl_custom`` and from Ubuntu copy the built kernel there...

.. code-block:: bash

    cp vmlinux /mnt/c/wsl_custom/

Create a file named ``.wslconfig`` in your Windows user directory (eg. ``C:\Users\username\.wslconfig``) containing...

.. code-block:: bash

    [wsl2]
    kernel=C:\\wsl_custom\\vmlinux

To use the new kernel you need to restart WSL (by running ``wsl --shutdown`` or restarting you laptop and starting Ubuntu again).
After this, every time WSL starts it will load your custom kernel.

Each time WSL starts you will need to load the CAN kernel modules...

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo modprobe can
    sudo modprobe can-raw
    sudo modprobe vcan

Then you can create a virtual CAN device as follows...

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
    sudo ip link set vcan0 mtu 16
    sudo ip link set up vcan0

If this all works you should see ``vcan0`` listed as a network interface. For example, ``ifconfig`` should show...

.. code-block:: bash

    vcan0: flags=193<UP,RUNNING,NOARP>  mtu 16
            unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 1000  (UNSPEC)
            RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
            RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
            TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
            TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

You can install ``SocketCAN`` utilities...

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install can-utils

and then use the Virtual CAN interface ``vcan0`` with these. eg. In one Ubuntu shell run...

.. code-block:: bash

    candump vcan0

and at the same time, in another Ubuntu shell run...

.. code-block:: bash

    cansend vcan0 321#AABBCCDDEEFF

The above command sends a CAN Frame with ID = ``0x321`` and 6 bytes of data ``0xAABBCCDDEEFF`` to ``vcan0``.
You should see it in the output from ``candump vcan0`` like this...

.. code-block:: bash

    vcan0  321   [6]  AA BB CC DD EE FF
