Using the console
=================

Previous: :ref:`learning_layout`

A console is provided in which you can enter commands and see log messages from the application.
On an embedded platform this is usually provided as a serial console over UART.
On the POSIX platform, it is provided in the standard I/O of the shell in which the application is executed.

If you press return, you should see that a prompt ``>`` appears, indicating commands may be entered.
If you enter the command ``help`` and press return a list of available commands is printed.

Available Console Commands
--------------------------

POSIX Platform
++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

 > help
 can        - Can system.
   info     - print bus info
   send     - send frame: id data[8]
              [send 0x123 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8] sends to CAN_0 Frame(CanId = 0x123)
 help       - Show all commands or specific help for a command given as parameter.
 lc         - lifecycle command
   reboot   - reboot the system
   poweroff - poweroff the system
   level    - switch to level
   udef     - forces an undefined instruction exception
   pabt     - forces a prefetch abort exception
   dabt     - forces a data abort exception
   assert   - forces an assert
 logger     - logger settings
   level    - get/set levels. Usage: logger level [<component>] [<new_level>]
 stats      - lifecycle statistics command
   cpu      - prints CPU statistics
   stack    - prints stack statistics
   all      - prints all statistics
 ok

In the above menu printed by ``help``, indented items are sub-commands of the unindent command above it.

Explore these commands, look at the documentation :ref:`util_command`
and search the code for occurrences of ``GroupCommand`` to improve your understanding.
