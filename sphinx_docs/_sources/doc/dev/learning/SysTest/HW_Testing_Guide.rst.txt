         :width: 400
         :align: center

#. **Testing Sequence: ADC**

   *  Open Tera Term console.

   *  Give command “adc get 0” in Tera Term to read ADC Channel 0 (which is connected to Variable
      Power Supply. Adc Raw value and mV Scaled value will print.

   *  Vary the voltage using Variable power supply (Range: 0 – 5v) and ensure the values
      are matching.

      .. code-block:: bash

          adc get 0
          Adc Channel 0: AiEval_Poti_ADC -> : 1064 (raw) 1299 mv (scaled)
          ok
          412993: RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: Received console command "adc get 0"
          413000: RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: console command Succeeded


#. **Testing Sequence: PWM**

   Duty Cycle of PWM can be changed using 2 ways: through potentiometer or
   through console command.

   a. Changing PWM Duty cycle through potentiometer: |br|
      By changing the position of potentiometer, the duty cycle of PWM can be changed.

   b. Changing PWM Duty cycle through console command:

      i. Stop DemoSystem lifecycle using command **lc level 7**

         .. code-block:: bash

             lc level 7
              ok
             10133: RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: Received console command "lc level 7"
             10134: RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: console command Succeeded
             10135: RefApp: LIFECYCLE: INFO: Shutdown level 8
             10135: RefApp: LIFECYCLE: INFO: Shutdown demo
             10136: RefApp: LIFECYCLE: DEBUG: Shutdown demo done
             10136: RefApp: LIFECYCLE: DEBUG: Shutdown level 8 done

      ii. Through tera term change duty cycle to 20 % using command

          .. code-block:: bash

               help
                ok
               6937: RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: Received console command "help"
               7036: RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: console command Succeeded
               pwm set 1 2000

               PWM channel 1 (eval_led_green_pwm) set to 0x7d0 % On

               19355: RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: Received console command "pwm set 2 2000"
               19360: RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: console command Succeeded



          pwm set channel # value from 0-10000 |br|
          pwm set 1 2000

   * For 50% duty cycle use command:
     pwm set 1 5000

   * This command can be used to change the duty cycle for all available channels (currently - 3).
     Duty cycle can be changed from 0-100 % using values from 0 – 10000.
   * The following are the screenshots saved from DSO for 20, 50 and 80% duty cycle.

#. **Testing Sequence: CAN**

   i. Sending CAN messages using vcan.

      a. Send command

         - On the terminal stop DemoSystem lifecycle using command **lc level 7**
         - CAN frames sent can be seen as shown below.

         The CAN send command allows you to send a frame with a specified ID and data bytes.
         Upon successful execution, the console will return an ok message, confirming that the frame
         has been sent:

         .. code-block:: bash

            can send 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
            ok
            RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: Received console command "can send 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8"
            RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: Console command succeeded

      b. Info command

         - CAN info command provides information about the CAN bus.
         - This command retrieves and displays the current CAN bus information.

         Upon successful execution, the console will return the number of CAN buses:

         .. code-block:: bash

            can info
            CanBus : 2
            ok
            RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: Received console command "can info"
            RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: Console command succeeded

   ii. Sending CAN messages using EVB and PEAK CAN

       a. Open Tera Term console.
       b. CAN frames sent can be seen as below.

          .. code-block:: bash

              71022: RefApp: DEMO: DEBUG: Sending frame 1
              72022: RefApp: DEMO: DEBUG: Sending frame 2
              73022: RefApp: DEMO: DEBUG: Sending frame 3
              74022: RefApp: DEMO: DEBUG: Sending frame 4
              75022: RefApp: DEMO: DEBUG: Sending frame 5

       c. Open PCAN viewer. Configure Bitrate and other parameters as shown below

          .. figure:: images/pic13.png
             :scale: 100 %
             :height: 500
             :width: 400
             :align: center

       d. CAN frames sent can also be seen in the PCAN viewer as shown

          .. figure:: images/pic14.png
             :scale: 100 %
             :height: 500
             :width: 400
             :align: center

#. **Testing Sequence: IO**

   IO can be verified using 2 ways: through pressing the switch button sw3 on EVB
   or through console command.

   a. By pressing the switch button sw3 on EVB, the RED LED can be turned on. Here sw3 acts as
      input and RED LED as output.

   b. Changing the IO through console command:

      out set 1 1

      .. code-block:: bash

           help
            ok
           out set 1 1
            1 : EVAL_LED_RED -> ok
            ok

           330162: RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: Received console command "out set 1 1"
           330166: RefApp: CONSOLE: INFO: console command Succeeded
