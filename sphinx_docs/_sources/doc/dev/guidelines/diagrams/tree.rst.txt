Attack and Fault Tree Diagram
=============================

Attack and fault trees diagrams show how an asset or target might be corrupted.
They are used to describe threats and possible attacks to realize those threats as well as possible
malfunctions and sources of errors.

Diagram Model
-------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :width: 100%
   :widths: 15 50 50

   * - Name
     - Graphical Representation
     - Description
   * - Event, Violation or Failure
     - .. image:: _static/tree/tree-event.png
          :align: center
          :scale: 100%
     - The diagrams consist of a root, children and leaves. From the bottom up, child nodes are
       conditions which must be satisfied to make the direct parent node true; when the root is
       satisfied, the attack is complete or a safety goal is not achieved.
   * - Countermeasure
     - .. image:: _static/tree/tree-counter.png
          :align: center
          :scale: 100%
     - Countermeasures like safety mechanisms or security controls are usually modelled as
       :ref:`annotations <diagrams_annotations>`, but in this diagram they can also be shown
       as extra elements.
   * - AND and OR
     - .. image:: _static/tree/tree-andor.png
          :align: center
          :scale: 100%
     - If a parent node has more than one child node, they must be connected using an AND or an OR
       element. It is recommended to place these elements directly at the parent node, which
       reduces the number of lines in the diagram, see example below.
   * - Connections
     - .. image:: _static/tree/tree-connections.png
          :align: center
          :scale: 100%
     - Nodes are connected with straight lines, countermeasures with dashed lines.

Each node has a risk level, which may vary depending on whether or not countermeasures are
considered. These levels are usually described and discussed in an extra table or special analysis
tools. Optionally, the nodes can be colored according to the :ref:`diagrams_risklevels` table.
It must be clear from the context whether the risk levels are shown with or without countermeasure
considerations. If not, add an explicit description to the diagram.
