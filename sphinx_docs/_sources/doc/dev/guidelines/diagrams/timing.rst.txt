Timing Diagram
==============

A timing diagram is a specific type of interaction diagram, where the focus is on timing
constraints. It is used to explore the behaviors of objects throughout a given period of time.

Diagram Model
-------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :width: 100%
   :widths: 15 50 50

   * - Name
     - Graphical Representation
     - Description
   * - Lifeline
     - .. image:: _static/timing/timing-lifeline.png
          :align: center
          :scale: 100%
     - The lifeline represents an individual participant in the interaction. It is aligned
       horizontally and read from left to right.
   * - States
     - .. image:: _static/timing/timing-timeline.png
          :align: center
          :scale: 100%
     - States are represented by a *state lifeline*, which shows the change of state of an item
       over time. Optionally, the reasons/events for a state change can be specified.
   * - Values
     - .. image:: _static/timing/timing-value.png
          :align: center
          :scale: 100%
     - Values are represented by a *value lifeline*. In contrast to the *state lifeline*, many
       different values can be modelled.
   * - Duration Constraint
     - .. image:: _static/timing/timing-duration.png
          :align: center
          :scale: 100%
     - Constraints for a duration can be very useful. Ranges can be specified with *..*, e.g.
       *{n..m}*.
   * - Synchronous Message
     - .. image:: _static/timing/timing-sync.png
          :align: center
          :scale: 100%
     - If states and values from different participants have a direct dependency, the transitions
       can be modelled with synchronous messages.
   * - Asynchronous Message
     - .. image:: _static/timing/timing-reply.png
          :align: center
          :scale: 100%
     - If a reaction is not immediate, e.g. if a response is sent by another task or process, use
       the asynchronous message arrows.
   * - Timing Ruler
     - .. image:: _static/timing/timing-ruler.png
          :align: center
          :scale: 100%
     - The timing ruler is optional, but recommended. The appearance of the ruler can be adapted to
       the diagram, it may have gaps or variables like *t* and *t+1*.
