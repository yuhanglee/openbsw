Pull Request
============

Contributing
------------

To contribute to this project, follow the process described in
`CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/eclipse-openbsw/openbsw/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.
Every author must electronically sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement.

Description
-----------

A pull request description serves a similar purpose as a :ref:`commit_message`. Therefore,
**all rules for commit messages also apply to pull requests**, with the following exceptions:

- The **comment fields** are not limited to 72 characters per line.
- All **markup syntaxes** supported on GitHub are allowed.

| If a PR consists of just **one commit**, the pull request description can be **identical** to the
  commit message.
| If a PR consists of **several commits**, the pull request description should **summarize** the
  commits.

Approval Process
----------------

As per the `Eclipse Foundation Specification Process <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/>`_,
every committer has the "rights to make decisions regarding a Project", including the authority
to approve commits.

In OpenBSW, we follow that process with the following addition:

If the pull request is **small enough** and the committer has the **complete overview** of the pull
request and its **consequences**, the **committer can approve and merge** the pull request without
consulting other committers. Examples:

- fixing typos or software bugs
- improving documentation
- making CI more robust
- enhancing a feature

If the pull request changes **processes, strategies, fundamentals or important APIs**, the
pull request must be **discussed** with other committers. Examples:

- changing the workspace structure
- adding a completely new feature
- removing support for older compilers
- changing guidelines

There is always a grey zone. In case of doubt, the committer must consult other committers.

Tags
----

The following tags are set on PRs for OpenBSW on Github:

- ``tested_on_hw``: This tag can be set if a defined
  set of tests did run successfully for the PR's changes on the reference
  hardware s32k148.  Currently, the defined set of tests is just a simple
  "sanity check" that starts up the application and checks if the initial
  console messages contain expected contents.  This might change in the future
  to run the system tests involving CAN and Ethernet tests also. This tag
  can be set manually (by the author, if testing manually), or automatically
  (when hardware tests are automated).
- ``no_hw_test_required``: For changes involving only minor or non-functional
  changes, a PR can have this tag set instead of ``tested_on_hw``. This tag
  needs to be set be the author or by a project committer.

Every PR shall have one of those tags defined before being ready for merge.

Checklist
---------

The committer must take the following points into account before approving the pull request:

- Do the **commit messages** and pull request **description follow the guidelines**?
- Is the code **useful** and should it be part of OpenBSW?
- Is **documentation** provided?
- Are **tests** changed or added?
- Is the contribution, including code, tests, and documentation, **compliant with the guidelines**?

Some checks might not be applicable, e.g., if unit tests are explicitly excluded in
:ref:`module_spec`.

In case of findings, the pull request must not be approved or merged.
Alternatively, e.g., if it is planned to post-deliver the documentation, a GitHub issue must be
created and linked in the pull request.
