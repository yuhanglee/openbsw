Persistent Storage
==================

Overview
--------

:ref:`storage` is a module for storing blocks of data persistently at runtime. This data may
include individual configuration parameters written once after a software update, or runtime data
updated throughout the device lifetime by user applications or by other OpenBSW modules. The data
can be stored to various kinds of storage devices such as flash or EEPROM.

Plain flash memory can typically only be written after being erased first and both the write
and the erase operations work at a certain granularity (e.g. 512 byte pages for writing and 4096
byte sectors for erasing). In contrast to that, EEPROM supports writing without erasing and
allows writing individual bytes.

When only flash is available in a microcontroller, the behavior of an EEPROM can be emulated in
software while in the end storing on flash ("flash-EEPROM emulation"). The simplest way to do
this safely is to allocate two flash sectors for each data block and alternating ("swapping")
between the two on each write. Flash endurance has to be kept in mind though, in order to not
run out of erase cycles too quickly.

The storage API should take care of most of this complexity by providing a unified interface
for storing to different storage devices. Additionally, it ensures safe sharing of physical
storage devices between users by preventing race conditions and data layout overlaps.

It's most suitable for use cases where data should be copied ("mirrored") to RAM for modification.
It might not be ideal for loading read-only, memory-mapped data or in case copying must be avoided
to save memory or for performance reasons.

Features
--------

- reading/writing a block of data, identified by a unique ID
- maximum size for each block configured in a header file
- partial reading/writing with variable starting offset and length
- optional error detection (supported also when reading partially)
- can read to or write from multiple, separate RAM buffers at once
- support for various physical storages: ``EepStorage`` for EEPROM-like storage devices and
  ``FeeStorage`` for (SW-based) flash-EEPROM-emulation, and more to be added

Design
------

Basics
++++++

Data classes:

- ``StorageJob``: represents a read/write operation and holds the job details (block ID, buffers,
  offset, callback, result); passed around from one storage to another
- ``LinkedBuffer``: holds a buffer (an ``etl::span`` associated with a C-array) for reading or
  writing, can be linked together with other buffers

Grouping the job details into a data object provides flexibility and code reuse by having a
single interface that operates on the data. Jobs can be put into linked lists, making it easy to
maintain internal lists for queuing and bookkeeping. By allowing the buffers to be linked together
also, they are easy to pass around in variable numbers while keeping the interface concise.

Storage classes:

- ``IStorage``: interface implemented by the "storages"; it has only one abstract method:
  ``void process(StorageJob& job)``
- ``MappingStorage``: delegates incoming jobs to "outgoing" storages, maps incoming block IDs to
  outgoing block IDs used by the delegates
- ``QueuingStorage``: when called, switches to the specified task context and then forwards the
  job to a delegate storage; also takes care of queuing when the delegate is busy
- ``EepStorage``, ``FeeStorage``: low-level storages that take care of managing the data layout and
  error detection; might use platform-specific drivers for the actual device access

When the ``process()`` method is called, the corresponding storage will execute the job and finally
deliver the result by running the provided callback. There can be a tree of storage classes where
one storage passes the job down to a delegate, and one of them eventually finishes it by running
the callback.

Storages are kind of plugins that can be added, removed or rearranged depending on the project
needs. The "storage system" setup should stay fixed after startup and not change during normal
runtime. This document discusses mainly the "demo" setup shown in the diagram below. Whenever other
setups are discussed, it will be mentioned specifically.

.. uml::
  :scale: 100%

  component User
  component MappingStorage
  component [QueuingStorage] as EepQueuingStorage
  component [QueuingStorage] as FeeQueuingStorage
  component EepStorage
  component FeeStorage

  User --> MappingStorage
  MappingStorage --> EepQueuingStorage
  MappingStorage --> FeeQueuingStorage
  EepQueuingStorage --> EepStorage : In driver context
  FeeQueuingStorage --> FeeStorage : In driver context

Note that both ``QueuingStorage`` objects run their delegates in the same task context (referred
to as "driver context"), but each could be configured with a different context as well if needed.

Preparing a job
+++++++++++++++

In order to read or write data, users need to:

- allocate a ``StorageJob`` object
- initialize it with the desired parameters: the job type (read or write), the block ID, the RAM
  buffers to use, and the asynchronous callback that should be run in the end
- optionally specify a read/write offset for partial access
- pass the job to ``IStorage::process()`` and wait for the callback

Things to consider:

- the callback must be of type ``void callback(StorageJob& job)``, where ``job`` is the original
  job provided by the user, with the job result available via ``job.getResult()`` or
  ``job.hasResult()``
- the job object or the associated ``LinkedBuffer`` object(s) must not get deleted (e.g. go out of
  scope) until after the callback has returned
- it's forbidden to modify a job or the associated read/write buffers while the job is ongoing
- it's forbidden to call ``process()`` again for an already ongoing job
- an ongoing job cannot be cancelled
- there's no upper limit on how long the processing can take; in case the application cannot wait
  longer than a certain period of time, it needs to go into an error state and **not** do a retry
- in a multi-user system it should be assumed that the callback won't be run in the user
  context, meaning that potential race conditions need to be considered
- if multiple jobs are ongoing at once, users shouldn't expect them to finish in any specific
  order: even though FIFO order is most likely, it's not guaranteed because errors and
  different task priorities can affect the order
- when ``process()`` returns, it's possible that the callback was already run directly in
  the same task context (or in a higher priority task), so if a flag is needed to maintain the job
  state, it's important to set it before calling ``process()`` and not after, otherwise a flag
  value set inside the callback might immediately get overwritten

.. warning::

  An additional limitation present in restricted, single-user systems is that users might not
  be able to trigger a lot of follow-up jobs directly inside the callback, even if sending just one
  job after another. When users call a low-level storage such as ``EepStorage`` directly without a
  context switch, then the callback function is also run in the user context. In this case, when
  triggering another job inside the callback, it doesn't return immediately but recurses deeper
  until reaching a "base case" in which no more jobs are sent. If the recursion is too deep, stack
  memory will eventually run out and cause a crash. In multi-user systems this isn't a concern
  because the library protects against such recursion with internal asynchronous calls.

Providing the RAM buffers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

RAM buffers to copy to/from must be provided as ``LinkedBuffer`` objects, each with
an ``etl::span`` inside. Buffers can be linked together using ``LinkedBuffer::setNext`` method
to form a list of buffers, each associated with a separate RAM-area. This provides flexibility in
choosing which RAM location should correspond to which part of the block, in effect dividing the
block into parts. Storages may also use this mechanism internally to attach headers or footers
before or after the actual data.

Sending a job to the mapper
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When ``MappingStorage::process()`` gets called, ``MappingStorage`` (also called "mapper") checks
the provided block ID (``StorageJob::getId()``) and uses this to find the correct entry in the
``MappingConfig`` table, which contains all available IDs and the corresponding outgoing storages.
It then uses the configured ``outgoingIdx`` to find out which storage is assigned for the block and
passes the job to it.

Receiving a response
++++++++++++++++++++

After one of the storages has processed the job (i.e. it has read or written the data and checked
for errors), it will run the user-provided callback. It will do this directly in its own task
context (different from the user context in the demo setup), so users need to be aware of race
conditions in case there's any data shared between the user context and the driver context. In the
callback the job result, type, block ID and the read size (if reading) can be checked and handled
accordingly. This can mean, for example, setting some internal state variables to control the
application logic: in case of success, continue to the next step, otherwise go into an error state.

In case of error (i.e. ``StorageJob::hasResult<StorageJob::Result::Error>()`` returns true),
triggering a retry should not be necessary. An error is usually caused by mistakes in the
configuration, integration code, application code or inside the storage module itself. This means
that retries will probably fail too and just cause unnecessary system load. Or it might eventually
succeed but make it harder to detect and analyze the original problem. An error could also indicate
hardware failure, but in that case a retry might cause further data loss, so it's preferable to go
into an error state instead. In the end though it's up to the user to decide what to do in case of
error.

Thread safety
+++++++++++++

As already mentioned, users are responsible for handling any race conditions in the asynchronous
callback. They can be run in different task contexts: most commonly in the user or the "driver"
context, but it depends on the storage setup and could be any context. ``MappingStorage`` and
``QueuingStorage`` are thread-safe, meaning that users from different tasks can share them without
having to worry about race conditions. ``StorageJob`` is partially thread-safe, excluding the
methods ``init()``, ``initRead()`` and ``initWrite()`` that are supposed to be called by only one
user in one task context when preparing the job. The low-level storages ``EepStorage`` and
``FeeStorage`` provide no thread safety at all when called directly.

Advanced: mapper internals
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As mentioned before, when ``MappingStorage::process()`` gets called, the mapper first validates
the job, then looks up an entry in the ``MappingConfig`` table that corresponds to the job and
forwards it to the specified outgoing storage (a ``QueuingStorage`` object in the demo).
Before forwarding it though, the incoming ID (``MappingConfig::blockId``) needs to be mapped to an
outgoing block ID (``MappingConfig::outgoingBlockId``), which then gets assigned to a temporary
(outgoing) job. A temporary job is needed to avoid modifying the original one. Outgoing jobs are
configured with an "intermediate" callback implemented by the mapper. When an outgoing storage
eventually calls the intermediate callback, mapper then looks up the original job object from an
internal array and runs the user-provided callback.

Only a limited (but configurable) number of temporary job "slots" are available internally, so
only a limited number of jobs can be delegated at once. If all outgoing jobs are already in use and
another job is received, it will be added to a "waiting list". As soon as one of the ongoing jobs
finishes (i.e. the intermediate callback gets called), another job from the waiting list (if there
are any) will be taken for processing in FIFO order.

There is also another internal list, used for storing jobs that have failed the validation in the
beginning of ``process()`` method. This list is needed because the user-provided callbacks need to
be called asynchronously and the corresponding jobs need to be remembered while this indirection
(an ``async::execute`` call) takes place. Running the callbacks directly instead could lead to
running out of stack memory if the user triggers additional jobs inside the callback.

.. note::

  Besides the mapper, also ``QueuingStorage`` does internal queuing, so that additional jobs can
  be received while the delegate storage is busy. In the demo setup, mapper can send as many jobs
  as it has available slots, regardless if the ``QueuingStorage`` is already processing a job or
  not. It's important to keep in mind that since intrusive linked lists are used, each job object
  can only appear in one list at a time (and only once in that list). This is one of the reasons
  why sending the same job multiple times is forbidden: trying to queue it more than once wouldn't
  work.

To illustrate how jobs are processed, a sequence diagram of a successful read or write job is shown
below:

.. uml::
  :scale: 100%

  participant User
  participant MappingStorage
  participant QueuingStorage
  participant EepStorage
  participant "EEPROM driver" as Eeprom

  == In user context ==
  User -> MappingStorage ++ : process(job)
  MappingStorage -> MappingStorage : find delegate, map ID, enqueue job if slots taken
  MappingStorage -> QueuingStorage ++ : process(outgoingJob)
  QueuingStorage --> QueuingStorage : enqueue for async processing
  QueuingStorage --> MappingStorage -- : void
  MappingStorage --> User -- : void
  QueuingStorage -> QueuingStorage : switch to driver context
  == In driver context ==
  QueuingStorage -> EepStorage ++ : process(outgoingJob)
  EepStorage -> Eeprom ++ : read/write
  Eeprom --> EepStorage -- : BSP_OK
  EepStorage -> MappingStorage ++ : callback(outgoingJob)
  MappingStorage -> MappingStorage : look up the original job
  MappingStorage --> User ++ : callback(job)
  User --> MappingStorage -- : void
  MappingStorage -> MappingStorage : process queued jobs if any
  MappingStorage --> EepStorage -- : void
  EepStorage --> QueuingStorage -- : void

Advanced: rearranging the storages
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The purpose of the common ``IStorage`` interface is to make it easier to support new use cases by
just rearranging the storages. For example, in single-user systems, thread safety is not a
concern, so there's no need to switch to another context before calling a low-level storage. This
means that ``QueuingStorage`` can be left out and have the mapper call the storages directly
instead, so that everything (including the asynchronous callback) will be run in the same context.
This could also make sense on a very low-end hardware where applications must share resources and
work sequentially in order to save memory.

In case the mapper has only one delegate, it's possible to leave the mapper out and have users call
a queuing storage instead (in a multi-user system) or the underlying storage directly (in a
single-user system).

In case all storages can run in the same task context (but not in the user context directly), it's
also possible to have just one queuing storage and make the mapper act as its delegate rather than
vice versa (remember, in the demo setup the queuing storages are delegates of the mapper). A
diagram of this kind of setup is shown below:

.. uml::
  :scale: 100%

  component User
  component QueuingStorage
  component MappingStorage
  component EepStorage
  component FeeStorage

  User --> QueuingStorage
  QueuingStorage --> MappingStorage : In driver context
  MappingStorage --> EepStorage
  MappingStorage --> FeeStorage

|br|

Advanced: custom storages
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Additional storages can also be implemented, for example:

- storages for further physical device types (such as non-initialized RAM to retain data
  between restarts, or storing into a file if a file system is available)
- an alternative storage implementation that defers writes until later (until sleep or shutdown,
  for example)
- an alternative storage that uses less RAM for buffering but is slower, or vice versa
- a storage that encrypts the data before storing it
- a "safe storage" that holds the read data in an internal buffer, so that users can copy it in a
  safety-compatible way
- a "proxy storage" that forwards jobs to another core, CPU or over the network
- an adapter that translates storage API calls to a legacy API
- an alternative mapper that provides extra functionality like write-rate control, where too
  frequent writes to the same block get delayed artificially

In case a storage should reuse some functionality of another one, using composition (delegates)
should be favored over inheritance, in order to avoid coupling subclasses with one specific base
class.

It's worth noting that the purpose of the storage API is to make it easy for users to write robust
application code, meaning that exposing users to new pitfalls or limitations should be avoided if
possible. For example, during ``process()``, storages should keep the job object intact, so that
users can still recognize it in the callback and reuse it without extra effort. Also, all resources
needed for maintaining internal state should be statically allocated in advance, so that any
sporadic "out-of-resources" errors can be avoided.

If the storage access is inherently unreliable, for instance if a storage forwards requests over a
network, then it must also implement an internal retry to avoid any sporadic errors. This might
mean that in the worst case jobs can take quite long to finish (say, a few seconds or more). Such
delays can happen with any storage though due to reasons beyond their control, like high CPU load
caused by other, higher priority tasks. In any case, it's important to keep applications robust
against severe delays.

A proxy storage forwarding requests over the network:

.. uml::
  :scale: 100%

  component User
  component MappingStorage
  component EepStorage
  component ProxyStorage
  component Server as [Remote server]

  User --> MappingStorage
  MappingStorage --> EepStorage
  MappingStorage --> ProxyStorage
  ProxyStorage --> Server : Over the network

Integration example
-------------------

This chapter shows an example configuration with some data blocks and two underlying storages:
``EepStorage`` and ``FeeStorage``. The first one uses an EEPROM driver (i.e. an implementation of
``IEepromDriver``) for storing. The second one is still not implemented and will not actually
store any data for now.

Storage-related objects are bundled in a lifecycle system called ``StorageSystem``. Since most
applications using the storage API are located in other systems, they can get access to
the API via ``StorageSystem::getStorage()``, which returns a reference to the mapper object.

The snippet below shows the block configuration defined inside ``StorageSystem`` (copied from
``executables/referenceApp/application/include/systems/StorageSystem.h``):

.. sourceinclude:: ../../../executables/referenceApp/application/include/systems/StorageSystem.h
  :start-after: BEGIN config
  :end-before: END config

The mapper is configured with four blocks, each with a unique block ID. Entries must be sorted from
smaller to bigger block IDs. These IDs will be needed later when initializing the job object.

The "outgoing block IDs" need to match the order of entries in the second table, where additional
details like the EEPROM address and data size are configured. When configuring the address, make
sure it doesn't overlap with the previous block: it cannot be smaller than the address + data
size + header size of the previous block. For blocks with error detection, the header size is 4
bytes, for others zero.

Note: even though it makes sense to keep ``EEP_BLOCK_CONFIG`` ordered from smaller to bigger EEPROM
addresses, this isn't strictly necessary and the blocks can be in any order, as long as the
outgoing block IDs in the first table refer to correct indices.

``FeeStorage`` is still not implemented and doesn't have its own config yet.

Next, the various storage objects need to be declared. This is shown below:

.. sourceinclude:: ../../../executables/referenceApp/application/include/systems/StorageSystem.h
  :start-after: BEGIN declaration
  :end-before: END declaration

Note that the sizes of the block configs need to be calculated and passed to the respective
storages as template parameters.

The next snippet shows the construction of these objects (copied from
``executables/referenceApp/application/src/systems/StorageSystem.cpp``):

.. sourceinclude:: ../../../executables/referenceApp/application/src/systems/StorageSystem.cpp
  :start-after: BEGIN initialization
  :end-before: END initialization

Here, ``_eepStorage`` gets associated with ``EEP_BLOCK_CONFIG`` (a global constant) and the
EEPROM driver. The queuing storages get associated with the corresponding low-level storages and
the task context where those storages should run. Mapper gets associated with its own block config,
an "error context" and the outgoing storages (please pay attention to the order, more details in
the warning below). The error context means the context where to run user-provided callbacks in
case the job or the configuration is invalid. If possible, use the same context that is used for
callbacks of successful jobs also, i.e. the one that was passed to the queuing storages.

After transitioning to the "run" state, the storage system is ready to receive jobs from users.

.. warning::

  The order of outgoing storages passed to the mapper is crucial and must match the outgoing
  storage indices used in ``MAPPING_CONFIG``. In this case it means that ``_eepQueuingStorage``
  (storage index 0) must be passed before ``_feeQueuingStorage`` (storage index 1).

Example jobs
------------

This chapter shows a small demo application where a block is loaded into RAM at startup, updated
and then partially written back into EEPROM. If no existing data is found when reading, the RAM
buffer will be initialized with zeros.

The demo code is located in the ``DemoSystem``, which contains examples for other OpenBSW APIs
also. The read job is triggered in a cyclic call (``DemoSystem::cyclic()``) that is being called
every 10 milliseconds, and the write job is triggered in the provided callback after reading is
done. Please see the full code in
``executables/referenceApp/application/src/systems/DemoSystem.cpp``.

When ``DemoSystem::cyclic()`` gets called for the first time, a read job will be triggered like
this:

.. sourceinclude:: ../../../executables/referenceApp/application/src/systems/DemoSystem.cpp
  :start-after: BEGIN trigger storage read
  :end-before: END trigger storage read

Note that block ID ``0xa01`` corresponds to one of the block entries in ``MAPPING_CONFIG`` from
before. Additionally, we specify the callback to be run in the end, the read buffer to read into
and the starting offset. Using offset 0 means that reading will start from the beginning of the
block, i.e. from EEPROM address 10 in this case.

The job is then sent for processing and eventually the callback will be run. The demo uses the
following callback:

.. sourceinclude:: ../../../executables/referenceApp/application/src/systems/DemoSystem.cpp
  :start-after: BEGIN storage job callback
  :end-before: END storage job callback

The callback:

- checks the job type and result
- initializes the RAM data if the result indicates missing data (``Result::DataLoss``)
- prints debug output about the read result
- updates a variable inside the data
- reinitializes the finished job as a write job and sends it for processing
- finally, when the callback is run the second time, it prints another debug output

After this no more jobs will be triggered until the next startup. Note that the callback receives
the same job object as a parameter that was originally sent for processing (i.e. ``_storageJob`` in
this case). It's also worth mentioning that even though ``job.init()`` is called here for
completeness, it could be skipped as well because the specified block ID and callback are the same
as for reading.

What's different between reading and writing though are the used buffers and offsets. Even though
the whole block is read, only one byte is written back into the offset 4 (i.e. into the 5th byte).
This offset corresponds to the ``charParam0`` variable. This is apparent when looking at the data
type of ``_storageData``:

.. sourceinclude:: ../../../executables/referenceApp/application/include/systems/DemoSystem.h
  :start-after: BEGIN storage data
  :end-before: END storage data

Buffers with varying start addresses and sizes can be created as follows:

.. sourceinclude:: ../../../executables/referenceApp/application/src/systems/DemoSystem.cpp
  :start-after: BEGIN storage buffers
  :end-before: END storage buffers

The read buffer (``_storageReadBuf``) is initialized with an ``etl::span`` covering the complete
``_storageData``. The write buffer, however, is initialized with a span associated with only one
byte. Notice also how ``uint8_t const`` is used as the write buffer data type because unlike the
read data, the write data won't be modified by the storage module.
