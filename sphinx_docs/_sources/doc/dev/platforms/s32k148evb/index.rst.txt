S32K148 Evaluation Board
========================

Overview
--------

- The S32K148 Evaluation Board is a development platform designed by NXP Semiconductors, aimed at
  simplifying the development process for automotive and industrial applications.
- Eclipse OpenBSW provides a reference application for this platform which can be built
  out-of-the-box and flashed onto the evaluation board, enabling the user to test working features
  straight away, thus immediately providing a starting point for further development and learning.
