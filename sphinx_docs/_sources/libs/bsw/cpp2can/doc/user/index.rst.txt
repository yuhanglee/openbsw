User documentation
==================

The ``cpp2can`` module defines an abstraction layer for CAN,
enabling higher-level libraries or applications to use CAN
independent of hardware-specific implementation details.

.. uml::

    caption Primary classes

    package cpp2can <<Rectangle>> {
        class can::CANFrame {
        }
        class can::CanId
        interface can::ICANTransceiver {
        }
        abstract class can::AbstractCANTransceiver {
        }
        can::ICANTransceiver <|-- can::AbstractCANTransceiver
    }
    can::AbstractCANTransceiver <|-- ExampleCANTransceiver

Using CAN transceivers
----------------------

For each CAN transceiver,
a concrete implementation of the ``can::AbstractCANTransceiver`` class is instantiated.
While each concrete implementation will have its own configuration to set up,
from the viewpoint of ``cpp2can`` the only configuration needed is that each CAN transceiver
is assigned a unique Bus ID which is passed to the ``can::AbstractCANTransceiver`` constructor.

Once instantiated, higher-level libraries or applications use the ``can::ICANTransceiver`` interface
to perform operations such as...

  * Control the CAN transceiver's state
  * Send frames to the CAN bus as ``can::CANFrame`` objects using ``write()``
  * Listen for CAN frames received or sent, filtered in various ways (this is described in more detail below).

Example
+++++++

The following example initializes and opens the interface,
then sends a CAN frame to the bus:

.. code-block:: C++

    void doSomethingWithCAN(can::ICanTransceiver* transceiver)
    {
        static const uint8_t msg[] = {0, 1, 2};
        if (transceiver->init() != can::ICanTransceiver::ErrorCode::CAN_ERR_OK)
        {
            return;
        }
        if (transceiver->open() != can::ICanTransceiver::ErrorCode::CAN_ERR_OK)
        {
            return;
        }
        can::CANFrame myFrame;
        myFrame.setId(42);
        myFrame.setPayload(msg, 3);
        transceiver->write(myFrame);
    }

``ICANTransceiver`` states
--------------------------

The state diagram below shows the transitions that transceivers implementing ``ICANTransceiver`` follow.
The method ``getState()`` returns the current state.

.. uml::

    hide empty description
    state INITIALIZED #palegreen
    state OPEN #palegreen
    [*] -down-> CLOSED
    CLOSED -down-> INITIALIZED : init()
    INITIALIZED -down-> OPEN : open()
    OPEN -up-> CLOSED : close()
    OPEN -down-> MUTED : mute()
    MUTED -up-> OPEN : unmute()
    MUTED -up-> CLOSED : close()
    INITIALIZED --> INITIALIZED : write()
    OPEN --> OPEN : write()

Note that ``write()`` is not allowed in the ``CLOSED`` or ``MUTED`` states.

The different states allow or block CAN Rx/Tx as shown in the table below.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - State
     - Receive
     - Transmit
   * - CLOSED
     - No
     - No
   * - INITIALIZED
     - No
     - Yes
   * - OPEN
     - Yes
     - Yes
   * - MUTED
     - Yes
     - No

Representing CAN frames
-----------------------

CAN Frames are represented using the ``can::CANFrame`` class.
A CAN Frame is composed of:

* CAN ID - Both the standard 11-bit identifier format
  and the extended 29-bit identifier format are supported.
  ``can::CanId`` is a helper class to assist in forming and identifying CAN IDs.

* Data payload - The standard maximum payload length is 8 bytes,
  but this can be set to 64 bytes, as introduced by CAN FD,
  by compiling with the preprocessor define ``CPP2CAN_USE_64_BYTE_FRAMES``.

* Timestamp - This is expected to be set by the transceiver on receive or send.

Example
+++++++

In the example below, two CAN Frames are created.
One with a standard 11-bit ID,
and the other with a 29-bit extended ID.

.. code-block:: C++

    static const uint8_t canData[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    ::can::CANFrame standardIdFrame(0x558, canData, 8);
    ::can::CANFrame extendedIdFrame(can::CanId::Extended<0x17002345>::value, canData, 8);


CAN listeners and filters
-------------------------

The ``can::ICANTransceiver`` interface supports adding and removing listeners for...

    * CAN frames sent

    * CAN frames received

    * State changes in the CAN transceiver

.. uml::

    caption Listener classes

    package cpp2can <<Rectangle>> {
        interface can::ICANTransceiver {
            write(can::CANFrame, ICANFrameSentListener)
            addCANFrameListener(ICANFrameListener&)
            addVIPCANFrameListener(ICANFrameListener&)
            removeCANFrameListener(ICANFrameListener&)
            addCANFrameSentListener(IFilteredCANFrameSentListener&)
            removeCANFrameSentListener(IFilteredCANFrameSentListener&)
            setStateListener(ICANTransceiverStateListener&)
            removeStateListener()
        }

        interface can::ICANFrameSentListener
        interface can::ICANFrameListener
        interface can::IFilteredCANFrameSentListener
        interface can::ICANTransceiverStateListener
        abstract class can::AbstractBitFieldFilteredCANFrameListener
        abstract class can::AbstractIntervalFilteredCANFrameListener

        can::ICANFrameListener <|-- can::AbstractBitFieldFilteredCANFrameListener
        can::ICANFrameListener <|-- can::AbstractIntervalFilteredCANFrameListener

        can::ICANTransceiver "1" o-- "0..*" can::ICANFrameListener
        can::ICANTransceiver "1" o-- "0..*" can::IFilteredCANFrameSentListener
        can::ICANTransceiver "1" o-- "0..1" can::ICANTransceiverStateListener
    }

``can::ICANFrameSentListener``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An object implementing ``can::ICANFrameSentListener``
can be passed to the overloaded method ``can::ICanTransceiver::write()``
to provide a callback method which will be called when the CAN Frame is transmitted.

``can::ICANFrameListener``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An object implementing ``can::ICANFrameListener`` provides a callback
for received CAN Frames that match its filter.
These can be added to (or removed from) a list of such objects maintained by the transceiver
by calling the following methods of ``can::ICanTransceiver``.
Each ``can::ICANFrameListener`` object must be configured with a filter before being added to the list.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description
   * - ``addCANFrameListener(ICANFrameListener&)``
     - Add ``ICANFrameListener`` to the list of CAN Rx listeners
   * - ``addVIPCANFrameListener(ICANFrameListener&)``
     - Add ``ICANFrameListener`` to the front of the list of CAN Rx listeners, so that it will be called first
   * - ``removeCANFrameListener(ICANFrameListener&)``
     - Remove ``ICANFrameListener`` from the list of CAN Rx listeners

``can::IFilteredCANFrameSentListener``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An object implementing ``can::IFilteredCANFrameSentListener`` provides a callback
for transmitted CAN Frames that match its filter.
These can be added to (or removed from) a list of such objects maintained by the transceiver
by calling the following methods of ``can::ICanTransceiver``.
Each ``can::IFilteredCANFrameSentListener`` object must be configured with a filter before being added to the list.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description
   * - ``addCANFrameSentListener(IFilteredCANFrameSentListener&)``
     - Add ``IFilteredCANFrameSentListener`` to the list of CAN Tx listeners
   * - ``removeCANFrameSentListener(IFilteredCANFrameSentListener&)``
     - Remove ``IFilteredCANFrameSentListener`` from the list of CAN Tx listeners

``can::ICANTransceiverStateListener``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Only one ``can::ICANTransceiverStateListener`` object is supported by each ``can::ICanTransceiver`` object.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description
   * - ``setStateListener(ICANTransceiverStateListener&)``
     - Set ``ICANTransceiverStateListener`` as the CAN transceiver state listener
   * - ``removeStateListener()``
     - Unset the CAN transceiver state listener


CAN Filters
-----------

Two of the listener interfaces use ``can::IFilter`` for filtering CAN frames:

* ``can::ICANFrameListener`` is used to capture CAN frames received by the transceiver that match its filter.
* ``can::IFilteredCANFrameSentListener`` is used to capture CAN frames sent by the transceiver that match its filter.

.. uml::

    caption CAN Filter classes

    package cpp2can <<Rectangle>> {

        interface can::IFilter

        interface can::ICANFrameListener
        interface can::IFilteredCANFrameSentListener

        abstract class can::AbstractStaticBitFieldFilter
        class can::BitFieldFilter
        class can::IntervalFilter

        can::IFilter <|-- can::AbstractStaticBitFieldFilter
        can::IFilter <|-- can::IntervalFilter
        can::IFilter <|-- can::BitFieldFilter

        can::ICANFrameListener *-- can::IFilter
        can::IFilteredCANFrameSentListener *-- can::IFilter
    }

``can::IntervalFilter``
+++++++++++++++++++++++

A ``can::IntervalFilter`` is used to specify a continuous range of CAN IDs to match in a listener.

``can::AbstractStaticBitFieldFilter``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A ``can::AbstractStaticBitFieldFilter`` is used to specify a selection of CAN IDs as a static bitfield to match in a listener.

``can::BitFieldFilter``
+++++++++++++++++++++++

A ``can::BitFieldFilter`` is used to specify a selection of CAN IDs as a dynamic bitfield to match in a listener.

Example
+++++++

Below is an example of setting up a listener for CAN frames received
with CAN IDs in the range ``0x300`` to ``0x400``
using ``::can::BitFieldFilter``.

.. code-block:: C++

    class ExampleCanListener : public ::can::ICANFrameListener
    {
    public:
        ExampleCanListener() : _canFilter() { _canFilter.add(0x300, 0x400); }
        ::can::IFilter& getFilter() { return _canFilter; }
        void frameReceived(::can::CANFrame const& frame);
    private:
        ::can::BitFieldFilter _canFilter;
    };

    void ExampleCanListener::frameReceived(::can::CANFrame const& frame)
    {
        /*
        This is called when a CAN Frame in the range 0x300 to 0x400 is received.
        An action can be added here.
        */
        return;
    }

    /* Set up listener */
    ExampleCanListener exListener;
    transceiver->addCANFrameListener(exListener);
