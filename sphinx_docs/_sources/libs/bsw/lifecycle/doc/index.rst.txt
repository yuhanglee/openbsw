lifecycle - App Lifecycle Management
====================================

Overview
--------
This module provides classes and interfaces that allow the user to define and execute the lifecycle of an application.

Application Lifecycle
---------------------
An application running on a core usually depends on several services like an ethernet stack and other buses, a logger, a non volatile storage among others.

Each of these services as well as the application itself will at some point be initialized, run and eventually shut down. For each service a ``LifecycleComponent`` can be created that controls this service. The ``LifecycleManager`` is there to make sure these transitions are performed on the lifecycle components.

Usually the lifecycle needs to process in a certain order. First the hardware has to be initialized, then logging or networking, and finally the application itself is run.

In order to model simple dependencies between services each lifecycle component is assigned a runlevel at which it shall be initialized, run, or shut down. During startup the lifecycle manager goes through all runlevels in ascending order. At each runlevel, first all its components are initialized, and then all its components are run. During shutdown components are shut down in reverse, i. e. in descending order of their runlevels. Note that even if a component is shut down and run again by a sequence of calls to ``transitionToLevel()``, each component is initialized at most once by the lifecycle manager the first time its run level is reached.

Asynchronous State Transitions
------------------------------
A component implementing ``LifecycleComponent`` must provide implementations for the three state transition functions ``init()``, ``run()`` and ``shutdown()``. After registering a lifecycle component to the lifecycle manager, the lifecycle manager will make sure that these are executed at the appropriate time.

At the end of each state transition implementation the method ``LifecycleComponent::transitionDone()`` must be called to tell the lifecycle manager that the component has completed its transition. This explicit callback allows the implementation to schedule asynchronous operations from within a transition and return early, as long as the asynchronous operation eventually calls ``transitionDone()``.

All transitions are scheduled asynchronously by the lifecycle manager. For this an implementer of ``LifecycleComponent`` must also provide an implementation of ``getTransitionContext()`` that specifies in which async context to execute which transition. For convenience there are several derived classes that should be used as a base for implementing a lifecycle component. They handle the most common use cases and implement ``getTransitionContext()`` accordingly.

In the simplest case, e. g. when using the ``SimpleLifecycleComponent``, transitions are scheduled in the same context as the lifecycle manager itself.

The classes ``SingleContextLifecycle`` in :source:`include/lifecycle/SingleContextLifecycleComponent.h` and ``AsyncLifecycleComponent`` in :source:`include/lifecycle/AsyncLifecycleComponent.h` allow the implementer to specify a context in which to schedule the transitions, or even different contexts for each transition type, respectively.

A small sample lifecycle component could look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/src/examples.cpp
   :start-after: EXAMPLE_START lifecycle_component_definition
   :end-before: EXAMPLE_END lifecycle_component_definition
   :language: c++
   :dedent: 0

Lifecycle Manager
-----------------
The ``LifecycleManager`` in :source:`include/lifecycle/LifecycleManager.h` is the central piece of the lifecycle module. It stores the component registry and triggers initialization, running, and shutdown of these components. It is declared using a ``declare::LifecycleManager`` with static capacities of components, runlevels, and components per runlevel, and a system time callback.

Components can be added via ``addComponent()``. The function ``transitionToLevel()`` will initialize and then run all components in each runlevel, up to the target level. Or, if a lower level is targeted for a transition, all components in levels above the target level are shut down, in descending order of their runlevel.

Sleep/Wakeup
------------
Sometimes the ECU needs to be suspended, i. e. go to sleep and temporarily cease its function but not be completely shut down. To achieve this, the ``init()`` and ``run()`` methods behave differently with respect to ``transitionToLevel()``. The ``init()`` method of a lifecycle component is only ever called once when the lifecycle component's runlevel is reached from a lower level, whereas ``run()`` is called every time the lifecycle component's runlevel is reached from a lower level.

The lifecycle component can thus implement the ``run()`` and ``shutdown()`` methods to be complementary to each other, so as to start and stop the functionality, respectively. The ``init()`` method however should perform the more fundamental initialization that is not to be redone everytime the lifecycle component is suspended or woken up.

This also implies that if any sleep/wakeup runlevel transition is desired then ``shutdown()`` should not undo the work done in ``init()``, since ``init()`` will not be called again.

Lifecycle Logger
----------------
The logging component ``::util::logger::LIFECYCLE`` can be used to perform lifecycle transition logging.

Lifecycle Listener
------------------
In the LifecycleManager there are methods ``addLifecycleListener()`` and ``removeLifecycleListener()`` to add and remove listeners implementing `ILifecycleListener` from :source:`include/lifecycle/ILifecycleListener.h`. Each listener will be notified when a transition has happened.

Code Example
------------

An example application lifecycle is demonstrated in the following code snippet. The ``LifecycleManager`` itself is scheduled within the ``managerContext``. There are three lifecycle components. ``ComponentA`` runs its transitions in the ``ethernetContext`` and ``ComponentB`` in the ``diagnosisContext``, both are in runlevel 1. There is also ``ComponentC`` in runlevel 2, its transitions running also in the ``ethernetcontext``. The lifecycle first transitions from runlevel 0 to 2, then back to runlevel 1, and then eventually from 2 to 0 again.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/src/examples.cpp
   :start-after: EXAMPLE_START lifecycle_manager
   :end-before: EXAMPLE_END lifecycle_manager
   :language: c++

Simplified Sequence Diagram
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The sequence diagram of its complete lifecycle where most of the asynchronicity is simplified is as follows:

.. uml::
    :scale: 100%

    participant App
    participant LifecycleManager as LM
    participant "ComponentA [rl. 1]" as A
    participant "ComponentB [rl. 1]" as B
    participant "ComponentC [rl. 2]" as C

    App ->> LM ++ : <font color=blue><b>transitionToLevel(2)</b></font>
    par
        LM -> A ++ : init()
        LM <- A -- : transitionDone()
        else
        LM -> B ++ : init()
        LM <- B -- : transitionDone()
    end
    == All runlevel 1 init() tasks are completed ==
    par
        LM -> A ++ : run()
        LM <- A -- : transitionDone()
        else
        LM -> B ++ : run()
        LM <- B -- : transitionDone()
    end
    == All runlevel 1 run() tasks are completed, runlevel 1 reached ==
    LM -> C ++ : init()
    LM <- C -- : transitionDone()
    == All runlevel 2 init() tasks are completed ==
    LM -> C ++ : run()
    LM <- C -- : transitionDone()
    == All runlevel 2 run() tasks are completed, runlevel 2 reached, nothing to be done ==
    App <-[hidden]- LM -- :

    App ->> LM ++ : <font color=blue><b>transitionToLevel(1)</b></font>
    LM -> C ++ : shutdown()
    LM <- C -- : transitionDone()
    == All runlevel 2 shutdown() tasks are completed, runlevel 1 reached, nothing to be done ==
    App <-[hidden]- LM -- :

    App ->> LM ++ : <font color=blue><b>transitionToLevel(2)</b></font>
    == Runlevel 2 has been reached before, no need to call init() again ==
    LM -> C ++ : run()
    LM <- C -- : transitionDone()
    == All runlevel 2 run() tasks are completed, runlevel 2 reached, nothing to be done ==
    App <-[hidden]- LM -- :

    App ->> LM ++ : <font color=blue><b>transitionToLevel(0)</b></font>
    LM -> C ++ : shutdown()
    LM <- C -- : transitionDone()
    == All runlevel 2 shutdown() tasks are completed, runlevel 1 reached ==
    par
        LM -> A ++ : shutdown()
        LM <- A -- : transitionDone()
        else
        LM -> B ++ : shutdown()
        LM <- B -- : transitionDone()
    end
    == All runlevel 1 shutdown() tasks are completed, runlevel 0 reached, nothing to be done ==
    App <-[hidden]- LM -- :

Detailed Sequence Diagram
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The detailed sequence diagram for the first ``init()`` transitions only with asynchronous calls explicitly displayed is as follows:

.. uml::
    :scale: 100%

    participant App
    participant LifecycleManager as LM
    participant Async as AS
    participant "LifecycleManager:managerContext" as MC #yellow
    participant "ComponentA:ethernetContext" as A #lightgreen
    participant "ComponentB:diagnosisContext" as B #pink

    activate AS

    App -> LM ++ : transitionToLevel(2)

    LM -> AS ++ #yellow : schedule(:managerContext, LifecycleManager)
    LM <-- AS -- :
    App <-- LM --

    AS -> MC ++ #yellow : run(:managerContext, LifecycleManager)
    == Runlevel 1 init() tasks need to be scheduled ==
    AS <- MC ++ #lightgreen : schedule(:ethernetContext, ComponentA::init())
    AS --> MC -- :
    AS <- MC ++ #pink : schedule(:diagnosisContext, ComponentB::init())
    AS --> MC -- :
    AS <-- MC -- : (run)

    par both init() transitions are executed. Since they were scheduled in different contexts they can run concurrently.

        AS -> A ++ #lightgreen : run(:ethernetContext, ComponentA::init())
        LM <- A ++ : transitionDone()
        LM ->> AS ++ #yellow : schedule(:managerContext, LifecycleManager)
        LM <-- AS -- :
        LM --> A -- :
        AS <-- A -- : (run)

    else

        AS -> B ++ #pink : run(:diagnosisContext, ComponentB::init())
        LM <- B ++ : transitionDone()
        LM ->> AS ++ #yellow : schedule(:managerContext, LifecycleManager)
        LM <-- AS -- :
        LM --> B -- :
        AS <-- B -- : (run)

    end

    AS -> MC ++ #yellow : run(:managerContext, LifecycleManager)
    == All runlevel 1 init() tasks are completed, runlevel 1 run() tasks need to be scheduled next... ==
