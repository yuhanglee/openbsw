Routing detailed design
=======================

Each routing message uses an 8-byte header followed by its payload:

* 4 bytes: message ID (big endian)
* 4 bytes: payload length in bytes (big endian)
* N bytes: payload

``RxAdapter`` or ``PduTransportRxAdapter`` extracts PDU(s) from a payload according to its
``RxAdapterTable`` and implements the ``IReader`` interface. The ``RxAdapterTable`` determines
which PDUs a payload contains with the message ID and the payload length. For each PDU,
it defines a length and an offset in bytes, i.e., the position of the PDU in the payload.

.. _rxAdapterTable:

.. literalinclude:: ../include/routing/RxAdapterTable.h
   :start-after: RX_ADAPTER_TABLE_BEGIN
   :end-before: RX_ADAPTER_TABLE_END
   :language: cpp

``Router`` reads PDUs from channels using ``IReader`` interfaces and writes them to channels using
``IWriter`` interfaces. Its ``PduRoutingTable`` specifies to which channel(s) a PDU should be
forwarded as well as the outgoing message ID.

.. _pduRoutingTable:

.. literalinclude:: ../include/routing/PduRoutingTable.h
   :start-after: PDU_ROUTING_TABLE_BEGIN
   :end-before: PDU_ROUTING_TABLE_END
   :language: c++


``LegacyTxAdapter`` or ``PduTransportTxAdapter`` creates outgoing messages out of PDUs according to its
``TxAdapterTable`` and implements the ``IWriter`` interface. For each message, the ``TxAdapterTable``
determines the payload length and the PDU offset within it.

.. _txAdapterTable:

.. literalinclude:: ../include/routing/TxAdapterTable.h
   :start-after: TX_ADAPTER_TABLE_BEGIN
   :end-before: TX_ADAPTER_TABLE_END
   :language: cpp

Routing example
---------------

The diagram below shows a concrete routing path through the tables. A message arriving on
``PDU_TRANSPORT0`` with ID 18 is routed to ``CAN0`` (outgoing ID 1), which in turn routes to
``PDU_TRANSPORT1`` (outgoing ID 4096), which loops back to ``PDU_TRANSPORT0`` (outgoing ID 256).
This illustrates how the routing module chains multi-hop routes across CAN and PDU transport
channels using only ID-based table lookups.

The diagram is generated with:

.. code-block:: console

   cd tools
   python -m blob.routing visualize --channel PDU_TRANSPORT0 --id 18 \
       libs/bsw/routing/test/routing.jsonl

.. graphviz:: resources/routing_example.dot
