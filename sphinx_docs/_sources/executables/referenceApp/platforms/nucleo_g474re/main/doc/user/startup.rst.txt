Startup Code
============

The startup code (``platforms/stm32/bsp/bspMcu/startup/startup_stm32g474xx.s``) provides
the vector table and the ``Reset_Handler`` for the STM32G474xx.

Vector Table
------------

The vector table is placed at the base of flash (``0x0800_0000``) in the
``.isr_vector`` section. It contains the initial stack pointer, the Cortex-M4 exception
vectors, and the 102 STM32G474xx interrupt vectors. Every handler is a weak alias of
``Default_Handler`` (an infinite loop) and is overridden by a strong definition where
the application implements one (e.g. ``HardFault_Handler``, ``FDCAN1_IT0_IRQHandler``).

Reset Handler
-------------

``Reset_Handler`` executes the following sequence:

1. Load the initial stack pointer (``_estack``).
2. Copy the ``.data`` section from flash to SRAM.
3. Zero-fill the ``.bss`` section.
4. Enable the FPU (CP10/CP11 full access in ``CPACR``, followed by ``dsb``/``isb``).
5. Call ``SystemInit()`` (PLL and early peripheral setup, defined in ``main.cpp``).
6. Call ``__libc_init_array`` (C++ global/static constructors).
7. Call ``main()``.

The startup code does not mask or unmask interrupts; interrupt control is left to the
FreeRTOS port once the scheduler starts.

Memory Layout
-------------

The linker script places code in 512 KB flash at ``0x0800_0000``. The STM32G474RE has
128 KB of contiguous SRAM at ``0x2000_0000`` (SRAM1 80 KB + SRAM2 16 KB + CCM SRAM
32 KB, which is aliased at ``0x2001_8000``), but the linker script defines the RAM
region with ``LENGTH = 127K``: the top 1 KB (``0x2001_FC00``-``0x2002_0000``) is
reserved for the hard fault handler dump region and is left untouched so it survives
reset. Data is placed in the 127 KB RAM region and the stack grows down from
``_estack = 0x2001_FC00``.
